# B1C5DictionaryOfWords

## Practice: Dictionary of Words

You are going to buid a C# Dictionary to represent an actual dictionary. Each KeyValuePair within the Dictionary will contain a single word as the key, and a definition as the value. Below is some starter code. You need to add a few more words and definitions to the dictionary.

After you have added them, use square bracket notation to output the definition of two of the words to the console.

Lastly, use the foreach loop to iterate over the KeyValuePairs and display the entire dictionary to the console.

```
/*
Create a dictionary with key value pairs to
represent words (key) and its definition (value)
*/
Dictionary<string, string> wordsAndDefinitions = new Dictionary<string, string>();

/* Add several more words and their definitions
wordsAndDefinitions.Add("Awesome", "The feeling of students when they are learning C#"); */

/*
Use square brackets to get the definition of two of the
words and then output them to the console
*/

/*
Below, loop over the wordsAndDefinitions dictionary to get the following output:
The definition of (WORD) is (DEFINITION)
The definition of (WORD) is (DEFINITION)
The definition of (WORD) is (DEFINITION)
*/

foreach (KeyValuePair<string, string> word in wordsAndDefinitions)
{
}
```
